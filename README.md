# solardial_clock

This little project is my first attemp to work with data from an API. 


It is structured in three parts:

1. A solar dial clock...

... which is a 24h clock face that visualizes the day and night length. 

2. A few digitals clocks...

... that show the current time, the time of the day's first light (the begin of the civil twilight), the time of the day's sunrise, the time of the day's sunset, 
and the time of the day's last light (the end of the civil twilight).

3. The weather...

...that shows the current temperature as well as a weather icon.


NOTE:
The program uses the https://openweathermap.org/ API that requires an API key. You have to include your own key in the clock_canvas_without_key.js file at line 215.
